The scooped weight was measured at the end of the experiment for each subject. The average scooped weight per demonstration is computed given the total number of demonstrations.

The use of visual feedback (i.e. was the subject able to see what he/she was scooping vs. the arm pointing downwards) was determined by looking at individual videos of the dmeonstrations and annotating by hand.
